# Security

This is an early-stage project. The default configuration is for a **trusted local machine only**: it uses development credentials, plain HTTP, Keycloak development mode and permissive database schema management. Do not expose it to the Internet.

To report a vulnerability, contact the maintainers privately (see [AUTHORS](../AUTHORS)) rather than opening a public issue.

## Roles

The Keycloak realm roles are `member`, `lead` and `admin`. A user without one of these roles is rejected with `403 Forbidden`.

The default users installed by `contrib/keycloak/realm.json` in the development environment are

* Member: `member` / `member`
* Lead: `lead` / `lead`
* Admin: `admin` / `admin`

The Keycloak admin console (<http://localhost:8180/admin>) uses `admin` / `admin`. The `cisys-backend` service account, which signs users out when cisys shuts down, uses the secret `cisys` and can manage the realm's users. Replace all of these credentials before any shared deployment.

Without signing in, `GET /api/branding/public`, `GET /api/branding/logo`, `GET /api/stats/public`, the public project page (`GET /api/project-pages/{name}`, `GET /api/project-pages/{name}/builds/{buildId}` and its build logs) and `GET /api/project-pages/{name}/branches` for public projects are readable. The project page accepts an optional `branch` query parameter, which filters the builds but applies the same public/private visibility rules. The statistics are aggregate counts computed from public projects only (public projects, their builds by status, success rate, last build time). Private projects and their builds are left out of every number, and no names, repository URLs, logs or users are exposed. The server caches the result for `STATS_CACHE_SECONDS` (default 30) seconds. The branch endpoint returns remote branch names for public projects. For private projects it requires the same member/admin access as the page and returns only the branches that already have builds, so the private repository is never read; anonymous callers and users without access receive `404`.

Private projects (and their build history and logs) are visible only to their members and to admins. Membership is recorded with the immutable Keycloak subject (`sub`), not the user name. A project always has exactly one `OWNER` member — the project's creator — and any number of `MEMBER` members. A project that is not visible to the caller is reported as `404 Not Found`.

### Project membership

* Every project has exactly one `OWNER` member, its creator, recorded atomically when the project is created. Other members hold the `MEMBER` role. Ownership cannot be transferred or removed through the API; removing the `OWNER` answers `409 Conflict`.
* Starting builds requires the Lead or Admin role, and a project membership; admins bypass membership. Editing a project and pinning its builds require the Lead role and being the project's `OWNER`, or the Admin role. Apart from member management by the `OWNER`, project membership never grants permissions the caller's global role does not allow — the global role decides what you can do, membership decides on which projects.
* Listing members (`GET /api/projects/{id}/members`) requires being a member of the project, or an admin. Adding (`POST`) and removing (`DELETE`) members requires being the project's `OWNER`, whatever the global role, or an admin. Only the `MEMBER` role is assignable; the `OWNER` role is never assignable through the membership API, and raw subject IDs are never exposed — the API accepts and returns usernames.
* Member-management endpoints resolve usernames to Keycloak through the `cisys-backend` service account; the membership endpoints only read users, but the account holds Keycloak's `manage-users` role, which signing users out on shutdown needs, so keep its secret protected.
* `ownerSubject` is kept as a denormalized pointer for the `owned` flag and for admins; project membership is the source of truth for authorization.

User subjects are returned to admins only:

| Field                                         | Member | Lead | Admin |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :----- | :--- | :---- |
| Project `owned` (the caller owns the project) | yes    | yes  | yes   |
| Project `ownerSubject`                        | no     | no   | yes   |
| Build `requestedBy`                           | no     | no   | yes   |
| Build `credentialRef`                         | no     | no   | yes   |

The public project page and the public statistics never include them.

The private flag controls visibility inside cisys; it does not grant or restrict Git access.

## Authentication

* The browser signs in with the Keycloak authorization-code flow with PKCE (`S256`) as the public client `cisys-ui`. Direct access grants are disabled in the development realm.
* The backend validates bearer access tokens and reads roles from `realm_access/roles`.
* CORS allows `http://localhost:5173` only. Change `quarkus.http.cors.origins` for any other frontend origin.

## Build runner

The runner is always on. It lets leads and admins run code from a Git repository in a container on the backend host, using only images an admin has allowed on the **Images** page.

**Trust boundary:** access to the container engine (in particular the Docker socket) grants host-level control to the backend. The limits below are not a hostile-code sandbox. Use a dedicated Linux machine, disk quotas and trusted repositories only.

Controls that are in place

* Only HTTPS repositories on an allowed host are accepted for builds and branch discovery; redirects, embedded credentials, query strings, fragments and non-default ports are rejected. See [Repository addresses](#repository-addresses).
* Branch discovery for private projects is not attempted because credentials are not stored on the project; the endpoint returns an empty list with reason `private_repository`.
* Branch names are validated as Git references. Builds may only use images an admin has allowed; image names are validated against a restrictive pattern.
* The branch is fetched afresh with JGit at depth 1 to read its workflow file and commit ID. The build then builds an image from the workflow: it installs `git`, `make`, `podman` and `podman-compose` as root if needed, clones the branch at that commit as `65534:65534`, and runs the steps as `65534:65534` without network. These two setup steps have network access.
* The image build runs with `no-new-privileges`, 1 GiB of memory and one CPU under Podman; Docker applies neither limit. The image is removed when the build ends.
* Builds run up to the concurrency limit (default 1, at most 16 when set by an admin); further requests wait in a bounded queue. Each build times out after ten minutes. Output is stored in full, up to the `BUILD_LOG_MAX_BYTES` safety limit (default 1 GiB); output beyond it is discarded and the build is marked truncated.
* Builds left in the `RUNNING` state by a server restart are marked `FAILED` at startup. Startup also removes leftover `cisys-build-*` containers and images and `cisys-*` checkout directories from an unclean stop; a cleanup failure is logged and does not stop startup.

### Repository addresses

* Only HTTPS repositories on `cisys.git.allowed-hosts` are accepted; the default is `github.com` and `gitlab.com`.
* Every address the host resolves to is checked. Loopback, private, link-local, multicast, documentation and metadata ranges are rejected, including IPv4-mapped IPv6 forms such as `::ffff:127.0.0.1`. An administrator can allow an internal range explicitly through `cisys.git.allowed-networks`.
* The check runs when a project is created, when a build starts, and again immediately before JGit fetches, because DNS can change after a project was saved. A host that resolves to a blocked address fails the build with `Build failed: The repository host resolves to a blocked address`.
* Branch discovery reads the project's own repository URL, never a URL supplied by the caller.

Known gaps

* Repository checkout size is not bounded.
* Runner and Podman operation on Windows/WSL has not been verified.
* Credentials are not scoped to individual projects; only admins may reference one.
* DNS rebinding between the address check and JGit's own connection is not fully prevented, because JGit resolves the host again when it connects.

### Git credentials

For private repositories set an environment variable named `CISYS_GIT_<NAME>` to a read-only provider token in the backend environment before starting it, then enter the variable name in the build form as an admin. The value is never stored in the database. The image build receives it as a build secret mounted for the clone step only; it is not stored in the image and later steps cannot read it. Never place secrets in workflow files or build output; each build stores its workflow file.

## Public access limits

The public project page, its builds, logs and branches, and the public statistics are readable without signing in.

* An anonymous log request returns at most `cisys.public.log-max-bytes` (default 2 MiB) in one response. `offset`, `limit` and `tail` select a range; the `X-Log-Size`, `X-Log-Offset` and `X-Log-Length` headers let a client continue where the response ended. The UI pages through the limit for **Download log**; when a page is rate limited it waits for `Retry-After` and continues from the same offset, so a large anonymous download completes across windows.
* Signed-in visitors are not capped on this endpoint, so the build page keeps the complete log and the full download works as before. This assumes accounts are trusted; if registration is open, an account can be used to bypass the anonymous limits.
* Anonymous requests to `/api/project-pages/**` (including branch discovery, which runs `git ls-remote`) and `/api/stats/public` are counted per client address in a fixed window: `cisys.public.rate-limit.requests` per `cisys.public.rate-limit.window-seconds` (default 120 per 60 s). Exceeding it returns `429` with `Retry-After`. Signed-in callers are not counted.
* The counter lives in this process: it resets on restart, is not shared between instances, and tracks at most `cisys.public.rate-limit.max-clients` addresses (`0` removes the bound). When that many live windows exist, one window is evicted and the new visitor admitted, so a flood of addresses cannot lock new visitors out, and purging and eviction stay constant-time per request.
* Behind a reverse proxy, set `quarkus.http.proxy.proxy-address-forwarding=true` and `quarkus.http.proxy.enable-forwarded-host=true` and have the proxy send `Forwarded` or `X-Forwarded-For`. Otherwise every visitor shares the proxy's address and therefore one bucket.

## TLS

The application is not configured for TLS. Terminate TLS in a reverse proxy, or configure the [Quarkus TLS registry](https://quarkus.io/guides/tls-registry-reference), before any shared deployment. Keycloak must also be moved off `start-dev` and onto HTTPS in that case.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the planned hardening work.
