# Architecture

## Backend

[**cisys**](https://github.com/mnemosyne-systems/cisys) is built on [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) 25 and [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) 3.40 using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database.

The sources are in `src/backend/main/java/ai/mnemosyne/cisys`.

* The data model uses JPA entities backed by [Hibernate ORM Panache](https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache): `Project`, `Build`, `Branding` and `Settings`.
* HTTP endpoints use JAX-RS via [Quarkus REST](https://quarkus.io/guides/rest): `ProjectResource` (`/api/session`, `/api/projects`), `BuildResource` (`/api/projects/{projectId}/builds`), `BrandingResource` (`/api/branding`) and `SettingsResource` (`/api/settings`).
* `BuildLogs` stores each build log as one PostgreSQL large object, using JDBC and the pgjdbc `LargeObjectManager` directly rather than Hibernate. Output is appended while the build runs and streamed back from `/api/projects/{projectId}/builds/{buildId}/log`, about 1 MB per short transaction, so a log is never held in memory whole. cisys supports PostgreSQL only.
* `BuildRunner` fetches repositories with [JGit](https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/) and runs builds through the Docker or Podman command line. It claims `QUEUED` builds in request order, up to the concurrency limit set under Settings or in configuration.
* `BuildRetention` is a [scheduled](https://quarkus.io/guides/scheduler) job that deletes each project's expired, unpinned builds in batches with one SQL statement per batch; the `lo_manage` trigger removes their logs.
* Authentication uses [Quarkus OIDC](https://quarkus.io/guides/security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication) in `service` mode with Keycloak realm roles.

Quarkus configuration is in `src/backend/main/resources/application.properties`. The schema is managed by [Flyway](https://quarkus.io/guides/flyway) migrations in `src/backend/main/resources/db/migration`, applied at startup; Hibernate only validates it. Databases created before migrations existed are adopted automatically. Until the 1.0 release the whole schema is one repeatable migration, `R__schema.sql`, which is changed in place and must stay idempotent; Flyway reruns it whenever it changes. It only adds schema and does not convert existing data, so after a change that needs existing rows converted, the database must be recreated with `make reset`. Project membership is such a change: projects created before it have no `OWNER` membership.

## Frontend

The frontend is in `src/frontend`. It is a [React](https://react.dev/) application bundled with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. The entry point is `src/main.jsx`.

Authentication uses [keycloak-js](https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/javascript-adapter) with PKCE, and the frontend calls the backend API at `http://localhost:8080/api`.

The `src/components` directory and `src/lib/utils.ts` were copied from [BilletSys](https://github.com/mnemosyne-systems/billetsys) under the Eclipse Public License 2.0. Most ticket-specific components are reference code and require their original supporting modules before use.

## Entity Model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    PROJECT {
        BIGINT id PK
        STRING name
        STRING repository_url
        BOOLEAN private_repository
        STRING owner_subject
    }

    BUILD {
        BIGINT id PK
        BIGINT project_id
        STRING requested_by
        STRING status
        STRING revision
        STRING branch
        STRING image
        STRING workflow
        STRING image_digest
        INTEGER exit_code
        BOOLEAN log_truncated
        BOOLEAN pinned
        OID log_oid
        TIMESTAMP started_at
        TIMESTAMP finished_at
    }

    BRANDING {
        BIGINT id PK
        STRING name
        STRING header_color
        STRING heading_color
        STRING button_color
        TEXT logo
        TEXT background
    }

    SETTINGS {
        BIGINT id PK
        INTEGER retention_days
        INTEGER retention_max_builds
        INTEGER max_concurrent_builds
        INTEGER max_queued_builds
    }

    PROJECT ||--o{ BUILD : has

    PROJECT_MEMBERSHIP {
        BIGINT id PK
        BIGINT project_id
        STRING subject
        STRING role
        TIMESTAMP created_at
    }

    PROJECT ||--o{ PROJECT_MEMBERSHIP : has
```

Users and roles are managed in Keycloak; `owner_subject`, `requested_by` and `project_membership.subject` hold the Keycloak subject. Each project has exactly one `OWNER` member — its creator — and any number of `MEMBER` members; membership is resolved to user names at the membership API boundary, subjects are never exposed to other users.
